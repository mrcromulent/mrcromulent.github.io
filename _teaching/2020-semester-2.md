Introduction
============

In physics, economics and engineering, we frequently encounter quantities (for example energy) that depend on many variables (such as position, velocity, temperature). Usually, this dependency is expressed through a partial differential equation, and solving these equations is important for understanding these complex relationships.

Topics
======

In this course, we study first- and second-order partial differential equations. The solution methods studied in this course include the method of characteristics, separation of variables, Fourier series and Fourier transforms.
