Introduction
============

This course shows the modelling process in the context of differential equations and case studies from a number of areas such as population dynamics, economics, electric circuits, mechanical systems, fluid flow, physics and astrophysics. Analytic methods from the elementary theory of differential equations and calculus are provided to allow for the analysis of the various models being investigated. The numerical package MATLAB is used to study model behaviour and to obtain deeper understanding of the consequences of analytical studies.

Topics
======

First order differential equations; second order linear equations; systems of first order equations; nonlinear differential equations; power series solutions.

Advanced Vector Calculus - Curves and surfaces in three dimensions; parametric representations; curvilinear coordinate systems; Surface and volume integrals; gradient, divergence and curl; identities involving vector differential operators; Green's theorem, Stokes' theorem and the divergence theorem.
